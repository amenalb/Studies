This part of my repository is dedicated to the concept of an AI application that I worked on with the AI Lab team during the Smart City Hackathon, where our team won 2nd place.

 Our goal was to create a "city of the future" based on urban data provided by UMK. In just 10 intense hours, we developed the concept of a system designed to simplify administrative tasks.
