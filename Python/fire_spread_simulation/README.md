# Fire spread simulation
This project is a fire spread simulation based on cellular automata. The simulation works on images from Google Earth. Users can interactively start and extinguish fires, adjust the wind direction, and control the speed of fire spread using sliders. The project utilizes NumPy for matrix operations and Pygame for creating the graphical user interface.
