# Life Expectancy Analysis
The project focuses on regression analysis as part of the "Statistical Data Analysis" course, conducted in pairs. The goal was to develop a regression model that predicts life expectancy based on various factors such as GDP, adult mortality, healthcare spending, vaccination rates, and access to education.
The team worked with the dataset "Life Expectancy Data.csv," which contains information from various countries, including data on the country's status (developed/developing) and variables related to health and the economy. The process involved data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and building linear regression models (both single and multiple variables). The models were evaluated using metrics such as RÂ², MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The project concluded with an analysis of the model quality and an interpretation of the results.
